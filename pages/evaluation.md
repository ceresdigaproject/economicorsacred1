# 3. Evaluation of Collection and Some Material Approaches

For our research project, Stepan and I took photographs of more than 70 objects together. Stepan, who identifies as Buddhist, captured some of the objects in Buddhist centres or shop windows belonging to fellow Buddhists. Meanwhile, my photographs were mainly taken from shop windows in bazaars of the cities I visited or in markets where I purchased household items. As a result, the items depicted in the photographs I captured were predominantly collected from non-religious settings in our daily routines.

As a result of the reception factors discussed in the previous section, Buddhism has become popular in the West, and objects have become more visible as a consequence. In this section, which analyses the material dimension of religion in the context of our corpus, we will look at how the various trends in the Western reception of Buddhism are reflected in the objects. The qualitative religious, aesthetic, spiritual or neutral meanings of some of the objects in our corpus will be assessed within the framework of my observations and the context in which the object is found. The sacredness of Buddhist objects, their religious aura or whether they are just objects will be discussed with visuals (Strong 2008: 50).

The legend of Buddha does not conclude with Parinirvana. After his death, his memory was preserved through relics and stupas. Over the centuries, pilgrimage routes were created and his teachings were re-recorded to keep his legacy alive. At first, symbols like footprints, thrones, trees, and Dharma wheels were considered sacred examples, while in the subsequent centuries, anthropomorphic images and sculptures emerged as reminders of him.  The current consensus suggests it was created in North West India during the first century AD, however, there is still some uncertainty surrounding this claim. There is a long-standing debate among scholars regarding the origin of the first Buddha image. According to Strong's 2008 work, the story of the Buddha image, which was translated from a collection of late Pali jataka, reveals that the images lost their significance and became mere material objects after the Buddha's permanent disappearance. The story recounts King Pasenadi of Kosala's commissioning of a painting to enable the inhabitants of Sravasti to worship the Buddha while he was away (Strong 2008: 51).

_`“…The next day, the Master, surrounded by his disciples, went to the king’s palace, and approched the great pavilion in order to see the statue in his own likeness. At that moment, however, the Buddha statue made from the most excellent sandalwood, seeing the Buddha arriving, … acquired as it were a devout mind and a living body, and thought: “Now that the most excellent living Buddha is coming here, it is improper for me to be seated on the highest seat. I must show respect for him.” As though thinking thus, the statue, so as to honor the Buddha, put one foot down from its seat, thereby showing signs of getting up to go meet the Blessed One. Seeing the Buddha statue doing this, the Master raised his right hand …, and, restraining the image, said this verse:

“Friend, stay there. Soon, O statue, I will be entering Parinirvana; therefore, you should remain behind so that my religion will last into the future for five thousand years….

Today, I commit my Order to you; for the sake of the wellbeing of the whole world, stay with my religion.”`_

The Jatakas offer insights into the Buddha's previous existence. In this instance, the Buddha aimed to create an object of worship after his demise. With this goal in mind, the Buddha transmitted his exceptional abilities into his artwork, thereby imbuing it with religious significance. Prior to this transfer, the painting had no spiritual value. Trine Brox's 2019 article provides a critical analysis of Walter Benjamin's The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, arguing that objects produced possess their own aura. Contrary to Benjamin's assertion that aura arises solely during the production phase, Brox posits that this quality can be achieved in additional ways.

The article argues that aura acquisition occurs not only during the production phase but also in the post-production marketing process. The article explores the reconstruction of auras of products sold in Tibetan Buddhist markets in China by utilizing the concepts of production conditions, packaging, rituals of sanctification and labor of faith. Although some of the issues addressed in the article overlap with our research, they are not precisely aligned. Nevertheless, it is beneficial to highlight the areas of correspondence.

Brox, who researched the Tibetan Buddhist market in China, argues that the mentioned components come into play when commercializing Buddhist material objects, increasing their religiosity. For instance, shops perform rituals of consecration in order to prevent the object from being perceived as a commodity. The author asserts that the shopkeeper's meticulous packaging and strategic store ambience both act as safeguards against commercialization. By creating a sense of sacredness between marketer and consumer, the danger of commercialization is eliminated (Brox 2019: 106).

When analyzing the 33rd image in the corpus, it is apparent that the ambience is in harmony with the objects. In the background, lotus flowers and oriental-style shalwars are present. The showcase is adorned with candles, with the intention of avoiding the sense of commercialization of Buddhism that Brox mentions, and instead to create an ambiance.

When looking at image 62 as another example, however, we see Buddha figures made under the influence of Chinese culture in the shop window. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no clergyman present who can perform a ritual to sanctify these items after they have been purchased. Additionally, in the background, there are plates and other kitchen utensils. The store does not confer a sacred character to these products based solely on the atmosphere. As an alternative approach, it may be too hopeful to take into account factors like the item's presence in a Chinese store and the accompanying articles associated with Chinese Buddhism. Perhaps the object is imbued with a sense of sanctity due to the ambient environment.

Lastly, when the picture number 1 related to ambience is analyzed, the Buddha statue holding a bowl in its hand is located on the discounted decorative products shelf of TK Maxx store. Accompanying the statue are a candlestick, a flower pot envisions a female figure influenced by Greek mythology, and coat hangers. The product does not show any packaging or sacralization rituals mentioned by Brox. In our opinion, there is no aura acquired during the production mentioned by Walter Benjamin, because the object was produced in China, exported to Germany and sold for only €14.00. The Buddha figure holds intrinsic meaning but its sacralization occurs only after its purchase, when the user attributes their own significance to it.

Holmes-Tagchungdarpa conducted a study on the sacralisation of Buddhist material goods in Kalimpong. Numerous Indo-Tibetan Buddhist products are manufactured on a large scale in Kalimpong, including prayer flags, incense, and maps. These products are then distributed by various trade network components, including producers, traders, and distributors. However, the participants in the network are not solely Buddhists. Holmes-Tagchungdarpa's research highlights ritual transformation as the crucial factor that affects the function and value of an object. This sacred process, known as Zung, requires both practical and ritual expertise. Objects are typically produced in appropriate forms for the transformation. When purchasing or donating an object for a shrine, Buddhists attach great significance to ensuring that the object has undergone the Zung ritual. Objects that are available for sacred transformation will be consecrated after the sale, under the customer's responsibility. The customer assumes responsibility for this consecration as the new owner (Holmes-Tagchungdarpa 2017: 239).

As part of the sanctification process, we will be analyzing image 15 from the corpus. The object can be found at the TKMaxx store in Bochum, where it is sold for £6.99 amongst discounted decorative items. There was no special presentation or packaging. While information on the place of manufacturing is unavailable, it is likely produced in a Chinese factory. Additionally, we have obtained a photograph of the same object from our corpus, image 105, captured in the home of a Buddhist. Although Holmes-Tagchungdarpa's article suggests that there should be a designated space for Zung, we did not notice any such space or seal for this sacred transformation process on the mass-produced object we observed at the TK Maxx store. Despite this, the individual who displays this object with its religious significance prominently in their home has assigned personal meaning to it.

At the introduction chapter there was a mass-produced Buddhist objects can be seen in image 31 at the Bochum Tedi Store, which is sold for £27. This sculpture, made in China, includes a solar panel that powers the candle in its hand. The technological advancements of Buddha statues are also evident with the use of developing technology. While the subject is worthy of further examination, our focus is on image 88. Here we observe the identical object present in the window of a hair salon situated on the same street as Tedi's. The Buddha statue is positioned on the windowpane with the primary intention of capturing the attention of potential clients, rather than for any religious significance. No interviews have been conducted to ascertain the religious beliefs of the shop owners. Nevertheless, from the analysis of the surrounding objects adjacent to the Buddha statue in the image 90, it is apparent that there is no religious connotation. Image 40 exemplifies the shortcomings in establishing the religious aura of the objects depicted during the production process. Although intended as a Buddha statue, the hand gestures portrayed cannot be identified with any of the recognized mudras. Consequently, the piece lacks the sanctity alluded to by Benjamin and Holmes-Tagchungdarpa at the outset. It is not feasible to prepare the 5 factors mentioned by Brox in a German supermarket. In the event that an individual purchases the object and seeks sacred transformation from a Buddhist teacher, what would be the teacher's approach?

Finally, the Western reception factors I mentioned in the first chapter have shown that Buddhism in the West is more of a philosophy or a way of life. This viewpoint is reflected in the photographed objects, such as those depicted in photos image 45 and 57, which contain short aphorisms intended to promote psychological well-being.
