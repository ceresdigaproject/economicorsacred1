# We See Buddhas in Our Daily Life

### Because he commercialized, but How ?

#### Slide 1 - Introduction

The collection that we are about to present to you, from my point of view, defends that the visibility of Buddhist objects in everyday life has increased because of their commercialization. This commercialization is about the modern lifestyle teachings that popular culture offers us, in addition how we modern people encounter and accept them.

In fact, we do not have to go far to understand this encounter and acceptance. For example, I told some people about our project in a short chat and it made them more aware of Buddhism and things related to it. After that moment they crossed the first threshold and started to pay attention to the elements around them, and the next step they realised that they encounter these elements very often.

The choice to purchase a Buddhist object and enter into this circle of ownership may differ from person to person. However, the act of purchasing a Buddhist object is primarily shaped by factors such as popular culture and the environment. This is because the marketing of these items often revolves around concepts related to psychology and physical well-being within the context of Buddhism rather than emphasizing its religious and sacred aspects initially. It's important to note that while these items can hold religious significance, however, its interpretation depends on the intentions of the individual who uses them.

#### Slide 2 - Methodology, Datas and Digital Aspects

We prepared the project in GitHub's page-based Collection Builder software. The .csv file we uploaded to Collection Builder formed the basis of our blog page. The most important feature of the software is the "cloud" function. This allows us to easily analyse the weights of the data in our collection according to different headings.

Digital methods add a new aspect to academic research. In particular, moving information from a PDF format to a more interactive platform opens up different perspectives for research and development.

Unfortunately, learning digital methods requires a separate learning process. In our example, Collection Builder appears to be a user-friendly software which is easy to navigate if you comprehend its logic. Nevertheless, restructuring anything on the website other than the .csv file can be a challenging task.

Trying to solve a problem through long conversations with chatbots and experimentation can be a tedious exercise, although we are not expected to be software developers. Nevertheless, digital techniques can be an enjoyable experience because of the satisfaction of achieving favourable results, if you have enough time.

A total of 73 items from Berlin, Bochum, Cologne, Detmold, Frankfurt and Hungary have been analysed. These items fall into two categories: those that can be **sold** and those with daily life functionality that are **not for sale**. Indian objects are the most common cultural affiliation. They are followed by Chinese objects and then Buddha figures from Thai culture. The most prevalent objects in our collection are those featuring the dhyana mudra, though we also possess many head figures without any mudra. Regarding the materials used to create these objects, a blend of artificial stone, wood, and wood plastic is prominent. China is the predominant producer when looking the places of production.

#### Slide 3 - Commercialization, Explained

A frequently debated topic in religious studies is the value of religious materials in modern mass production era. Many articles discussing this issue refer to Walter Benjamin's The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1936). Benjamin believes that the repetition of manufacturing and the impact of capitalism have mechanized the art object. This resulted in the erosion of the historical and original characteristics of the object and the disappearance of its ["aura"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/aura).

![Even the article become more popular.jpg](https://github.com/ceresdigaproject/economicorsacred1/blob/main/assets/img/Walter%20Benjamin.jpg?raw=true)


In the debate about the value of religious materials, Brent Plat noted in 2004 that it was a correct decision to translate aura as sacred or holy in religious studies. To simplify the understanding of the term aura, it is correct to see the "aura" of the objects as sacred or holy, as claimed by Plate.

Mass production of religious objects has made them accessible to all. Formerly it was exclusive just for clerics. This has resulted in a decrease of the barriers to joining a religious practice, leading to the parallel increase in religious commercialization as it becomes more widespread.

The commercialization and commodification of religion is not only a modern phenomenon. The medieval Latin church, invented a franchise system for indulgences, a new product that shortened the time spent in purgatory. The pope established a parallel distribution structure involving newly licensed mendicant orders alongside the parochial structure. This resulting competition not only solved the principal-agent problem in respect of agents who were difficult to control when they were far away from Rome, but also maximized the profit for the principal (Schmidtchen/Mayer 1997).

However, in our example, the market and society economize religion. As I understand from my street observations, social media observations and the literature, the desire to make a profit does not originate from Buddhism, but concepts such as meditation, yoga and spirituality, which are actually free, have been commercialized by people. These objects we see in markets or city centers are a reflection of this approach.

Buddha statues are seen as sacred as they have an impact on people and their environment. Objects are also considered holy because they exist between the sacred and ordinary. These roles and meanings create the auras of Buddha statues. However, most of the items in our collections are commercially produced objects. As a result, their meaning is only acquired once they are purchased from the seller, the taxes are paid to the state, and then placed in their designated location at home or in the shop. Not all items possess inherent aura.

Although this approach seems to put **Buddhist objects** and **things** in the same category, what I am trying to emphasise is that the meaning of the object is defined in the individual. If you are a Buddhist as a true believer, for you a Buddha object in the market is a figure to be respected or treated as sacred from the first moment you see it. However, in terms of commercialisation, it is highly unlikely that buddha objects will only be bought by Buddhists. Because according to 2018 data, only 270,000 (0.33 per cent) official Buddhists live in Germany.

Buddhism in Germany and Europe is very seldom described as a religion. General portrayals are mainly positive, especially when compared to other religions. The teachings, practices and institutions historically have shown to be easily adoptable and transformable, also in Western and secular contexts. Consumers of media and popular culture are thus engaged with already circulating scripts, master narratives and collectively shared webs of meaning. Such containers of stories, ideas and metaphors are products of circular transformations between East and West, tradition and modernity.


Generally, people are also more-or-less Buddhists who “believe without belonging, belong without believing, practice without believing or belonging or simply somehow identify as Buddhists without believing, belonging or practicing” (Borup 2016a: 91). It also seems plausible to assume an elective affinity between those who identify themselves as “spiritual, but not religious”, those with no religious affiliation (the group answering ‘no religion’), and people who in some ways are related to or have sympathy with Buddhism. people who are deeply inspired by Buddhism as ‘a way of life’ or as ‘a spiritual path’ would not necessarily call themselves Buddhists.

Since Buddhism doesn't have any formal affiliation or system to approve or disapprove of practices, it's simpler to engage in Buddhism-related activities than with other religions. Buddhism has a flexible structure, and you don't immediately get recognised as a Buddhist due to these practices. Meanwhile, Buddhism's image is perceived more favourably compared to abrahamic religions.
This message is refined by the media and advertising, promoting values like spiritual growth, personal identity, balance, and mindfulness.

As an illustration, if you are an employee of a large company, your employer may inadvertently be funding Buddhist practices through the hiring of a team of counsellors who conduct weekly meditations, rather than through an increase in your salary so that you can concentrate more effectively on your tasks. For instance, AOK, a German health insurance company, may consider yoga practice at studios as sports and cover the costs. However, they may not cover expenses for using a bicycle to attend a religious service. This illustrates the separation of religious commercialisation that I introduced earlier. Previously, religion was marketed internally to generate revenue, but now, products are marketed through religion.
