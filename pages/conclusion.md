# Conclusion 

The reception of Buddhism in the West has different dimensions. As discussed above, these receptions are sometimes observed as religion, sometimes as philosophy, sometimes as a lifestyle and sometimes as various combinations thereof. There are many reasons behind this situation. Both the historical process, the way Buddhism was introduced, the literature on the subject, and directly migrated people from the South Asia have affected this process of interpretation. Still, today, Buddhism continues to be seen as a philosophy or way of life, as well as a religion. In fact, our study does not examine the nature of Buddhism. However, these reception debates have led to the following according to our study. The effects of the adoption of Buddhism in giving meaning to the objects we encounter in city centers are noticeable in the context of the use of the objects. The objects we examine sometimes appear as religious objects, sometimes as mere decoration items, or as objects carrying various aphorisms which encourage a healthy outlook and bolster the individual's psychology.

When the areas where the photographs of the collection are collected are examined, it will be seen that the majority of Buddhist objects are found in markets selling decoration products and in the windows of hairdressers and massage parlors. Commercialization has been discussed as one of the reasons why we encounter Buddhist objects outside of their religious context. There is no single reason for this commercialization. However, with modernity in the West, the emphasis on spirituality and the changing perception of spirituality have brought about commercialization through the media. The role played by the media here is that it has led to the spread of Asian cultures, which were already in demand after the Second World War and the Cold War, through advertisements.

Academicians such as Walter Benjamin, Tine Brox, and Amy Holmes-Tagchungdarpa have conducted research on the sanctity of material objects. Of course, many other academics have done studies in this field, but the reason why I chose these three names specifically is that the samples and context they researched overlapped with our research. Sometimes the 5 steps developed by Brox for aura acquisition, and sometimes the lack of sanctification rituals mentioned by Holmes-Tagchungdarpa, have appeared as a deficiency in these objects we encounter in city life. However, there are also examples in our corpus of the approach pointed out by Holmes-Tagchungdarpa that the sanctity of the object is acquired after it is purchased. In the end, the aura of the object derives as much from ambiance as from intention.
