# Introduction

Buddhism and Buddhist objects became increasingly visible in Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The rise of mass production and faster distribution of products and services, as well as an increased study of Buddhism and growing Western interest in spirituality, are the primary reasons for this rising visibility. Taking a leisurely walk in any city in Germany in 2023, one is not surprising to find Buddhist objects in apartment windows, decoration shops, restaurants, hairdressers, in almost every area of everyday life. The Buddhist objects in the collection of our research demonstrate this widespread presence in cities and reveal the contexts of their use. The study concentrates on the rise of their visibility and explores the perception of these objects and the values attached to them.

  Further information regarding the objects can be accessed on the project's website. However, providing a brief overview of the objects at the start of the study will enhance the understanding of the research context. The collection contains Buddha heads, Buddha body sculptures in various positions, and mudra figures. The collection includes 73 different objects with figures produced under the influence of Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Nepalese and Thai cultures. The documented objects are located in Berlin, Bochum, Detmold, Frankfurt and Cologne in Germany and Budapest in Hungary. They are generally made of artificial stone, wood-plastic composite, wood, and plastic materials. The majority of the objects in the collection for which country of origin information is available were made in China. The process of selecting, classifying and identifying the objects is analysed in more detail in the Methodology section.

  The paper argues that the visibility of Buddhist objects in everyday life has increased due to their commodification. This commodification has occurred through an increased interest in modern lifestyles enabled by popular culture. In this sense, the problem of commodification arises from self-help teachings that market only certain forms of Buddhist practice. The "mindfulness" and "spirituality" economies, for example, have an annual revenue of millions of dollars (Doran, 2018). Buddhism, with its emphasis on rejecting materialistic values and encompassing numerous philosophical and ethical concepts, is marketed to Western consumers with a selective inclusion and it degenerates Buddhism's religious value.

The motives behind purchasing a Buddhist item vary from person to person. In my fieldwork, I have found that the meaning attached to an object is determined _after_ it has been purchased. Some people believe that these objects really reflect religious meanings, while others consider them merely decorative objects. For example, image 31 in our collection is sold in the decorative items section of a Tedi store. This item was once again (image 88) seen in the shop window of a hairdresser in Bochum. The shopkeeper positioned it in the outer window to draw attention from potential customers walking by. On the other hand, which we encountered image 15 in the decoration section of the TK Maxx store, was also seen in the home of a Buddhist. He attributed religious value to the object and placed it in the most visible place in his home, along with other objects. To summarise, the object begins with a neutral status; however, its meaning and function oscillate between two opposite poles, religious and secular, depending on the context. In the secular context, the significance of Buddhism is influenced by factors such as debatable categorization as a religion or a philosophy, and its portrayal in popular culture.

In sum, this paper explores the meanings acquired by the collected objects in religious and secular contexts, and the reasons for their increased visibility in the context of the perception of Buddhism in the West. The first section focuses on the reception of Buddhism in the West through the case of Germany. It begins with a historical approach to analyse the perception of Buddhism as a religion, lifestyle or commodity in the West. It then examines the changing perception of spirituality and the reinterpretation of spirituality as factors leading to commodification. The second part of the study focuses on the purposes of the objects in the collection and the variability of their meanings. Within the framework of these examples, debates on the sanctity of Buddha statues and the religiosity of material objects are analysed. Within the study, discussions of ambiguous concepts such as modernity and religion, spirituality and globalisation are touched upon. Rather than being a party to these debates, the reason for mentioning them is to show that the meanings of the objects can change when they are evaluated from different perspectives, and that the debates themselves often become the source of the objects meaning.
